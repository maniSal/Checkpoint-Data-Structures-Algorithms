1.Splay Tree
 I find it difficult to grasp how the rotations work after every access. The "splaying" operation is tricky because it changes the structure a lot and it’s easy to lose track of the node relationships.

2. Red-Black Tree

 Although I understand that it’s a self-balancing tree, the rules (especially the color properties and rebalancing after insertions and deletions) feel complicated to implement without making mistakes.

3. Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)

 The concept of cumulative frequency and how to update/query in O(log n) time seems very smart, but I still get confused when trying to figure out how the bit manipulations (using LSOne — Least Significant One Bit) work.# Checkpoint-Data-Structures-Algorithms
